Morse code is a binary communication system that uses sequences of short and
long signals called dots and dashes to encode text characters, numbers and
punctuation. Each Morse code character has a unique combination of dots for
short and dashes for long pulses. [Samuel Morse](https://books.google.co.ke/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Bj0DBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=samuel+morse&ots=8T4kpgMS4h&sig=F_BIVJDYKEEufXf1EYNA0Ffqp5I&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=samuel%20morse&f=false)
  and Alfred Vail originally
developed the Morse code in 1838 for use with the telegraph, a device that
sent electrical signals over wires. In 1851 a conference of Europan nations de-
vised Morse codeâ€™s variant International Morse Code. This was to address the
inadequacy of Morse codes in transmitting non-English text.
